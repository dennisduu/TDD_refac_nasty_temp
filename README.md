# Assignment: Refactor and improve legacy code, following a TDD workflow

Instructions for this assignment can be found on EdSTEM in two PDFs: one describing the assignment itself, and a separate appendix giving necessary math/physics background.

The overall objective is to iteratively refactor, improve, and add features to an existing standalone file called `nasty.py` (found here in the `src/` folder), all while writing *tests* as you go that (i) document specifications you're trying to achieve, (ii) ensure that any improvements work as intended, (iii) ensure that the new code (to be held in a file `lessnasty.py`) gives the same numerical answers as the old code.

## Git workflow

Git workflow is part of this assignment.  As discussed in class, you will create a semi-linear DAG with "merge bubbles". The only branch you should be pushing up to Github is `main` (that should bring along all the merge bubbles if you're doing things correctly).

## Use EdSTEM

Ask questions sooner rather than later.  Talk about things out in the open.
