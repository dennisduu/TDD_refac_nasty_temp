# Oscillation Simulator

This program write in python, it simulates the motion of a oscillating system. It uses basic principles of physics to model how an object moves under the influence of a cosine wave force and air resistance. 

# Instruction
1. Download the package
2. Run the simulation by "python lessnasty.py" in Terminal.
3. The result will be output
